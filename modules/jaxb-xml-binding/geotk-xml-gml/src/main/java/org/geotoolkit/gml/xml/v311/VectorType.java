/**
 * Vector instances hold the compoents for a (usually spatial) vector within some coordinate reference system (CRS). 
 * 			Since Vectors will often be included in larger objects that have references to CRS, the "srsName" attribute may be missing. 
 * 			In this case, the CRS is implicitly assumed to take on the value of the containing object's CRS.
 * 
 * 			Note that this content model is the same as DirectPositionType, but is defined separately to reflect the distinct semantics, and to avoid validation problems. SJDC 2004-12-02

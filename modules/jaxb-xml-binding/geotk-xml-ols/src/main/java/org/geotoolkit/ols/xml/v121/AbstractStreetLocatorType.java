/**
 * 
 * 	The AbstractStreetLocatorType is an abstract type  for describing the location on a street within an AddressType.
 * 	We do this because the components of a location on a street vary greatly throughout the world.
 * 	So that the schema can accommodate this variation we create derived types such as the
 * 	BuildingLocatorType which has the components for an apartment or suite or floor within a building.
 * 		
 *

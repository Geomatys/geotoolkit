#
# This is the configuration file for the Drift experiment. The model expects oceanic current and wind speed data
# in the "HYCOM" and "WindSat" directories respectively. Current implementation does not yet take arbitrary data;
# the model is currently designed for data of the following sources:
#
# HYCOM:
#    ftp://ftp.hycom.org/datasets/GLBa0.08/expt_91.1/2015/uvel/archv.2015_<day of year>_00_3zu.nc
#
# WindSat:
#    ftp://podaac-ftp.jpl.nasa.gov/OceanWinds/windsat/L3/rss/v7/2015/<day of month>/windsat_remss_ovw_l3_<date>_v7.0.1.nc.gz
#
# The HYCOM data are three-dimensional but the model will use only the surface layer with Mercator-curvilinear
# horizontal grid.  At each time step in the model, the drifting object displacement is computed as the vector
# sum of the oceanic current and the wind velocity, weighted by the values in the following table. For example
# if "Weight of current vector" = 0.8 and "Weight of wind vector" = 0.2, then the displacement vector will be:
#
#     displacement =  0.8 * current  +  0.2 * wind
#
# Note that the weight sum does not need to be 1. For example it is okay to alway give to current a weight of 1.
# Note also that the speed of Kuroshio current is around 0.4 - 1.3 m/s while the average wind speed over Pacific
# ocean is around 6 m/s. The difference in magnitude needs to be taken in account in the weight values.
#
# On each (current, wind) weights row, the last number is a pseudo-probability that this particular combination of
# weights occurs.  This number is used for applying colors in output images and for deciding when to stop tracking
# a trajectory. At least two sets of weights should be specified. The pseudo-probability sum does not need to be 1.
#
#
#   Current,  Wind,  Pseudo-probability

weights = 1,  0.01,  0.5
weights = 1,  0.03,  1.0
weights = 1,  0.05,  0.5


# Maximal number of trajectories to track. If there is more trajectories than this amount, the trajectories with
# the lowest pseudo-probability will be discarded.

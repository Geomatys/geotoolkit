 * Computes values at the location of grid cells from a set of values at random locations.

 * set of values at random locations (the input). However the class can also be used for
 * creating non-regular grids. For creating a non-regular grid, user should subclass
 * {@code ObjectiveAnalysis} and override the {@link #getOutputLocation getOutputLocation(...)}

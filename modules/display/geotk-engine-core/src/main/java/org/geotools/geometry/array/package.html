    Implementations of {@link org.opengis.spatialschema.geometry.geometry.PointArray}
    interface. A minimal {@code PointArray} interface is defined in ISO 19107. This
    package extends the minimal interface with services targeted for rendering purposes.
 
    <P ALIGN="justify">This package provides various classes for storing arrays of two-dimensional
    {@linkplain org.opengis.spatialschema.geometry.DirectPosition positions}. Each class is a
    compromise between various constraints like JTS compatibility, memory consumption and speed.
    
    The simplest implementation is {@link org.geotools.geometry.array.DefaultArray}, which just
    wraps a <CODE>float[]</CODE> array containing (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) coordinates. More
    sophisticated subclasses can compress data in order to hold big coordinate arrays with less
    memory.</P>

    <P ALIGN="justify">{@link org.geotools.geometry.array.PointArray2D} has an iterator allowing
    forward-only iteration through coordinate points. It does not allow random access or backward
    iteration. This limitation makes it easier to implements compression algorithms. As a general
    rule, users should avoid random access as much as possible.</P>

# This is used for testing a dump of the ASCII grid in RAW format.
# The "grid-with-raw.raw" file is binary data, so strictly speaking
# it should not be in this package, but we put it there since it is
# related to the Geotk implementation of the ASCII grid format and
# we want to leverage the same test suite.

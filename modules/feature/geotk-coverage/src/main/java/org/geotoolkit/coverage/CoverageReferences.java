/**
 * Holds {@linkplain WeakReference weak references} to {@linkplain Coverage coverage} instances.
 * Every call to the {@link #reference} method with the same {@code Coverage} instance will return
 * the same {@code WeakReference} instance. If all weak references to a coverage have been created
 * by the same instance of {@code CoverageReferences} (typically the {@link #DEFAULT} one), then it
 * is guaranteed that given:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     Coverage coverageA = ...;
 *     Coverage coverageB = ...;
 *
 *     WeakReference<Coverage> refA = reference(coverageA);
 *     WeakReference<Coverage> refB = reference(coverageB);
 * }
 *
 * then testing {@code (refA == refB)} is equivalent to testing {@code (coverageA == coverageB)}
 * Comparing the references instead than the coverages can keep comparisons mainfull even after
 * the coverages have been garbage collected. This is sometime useful for checking if two results
 * of a calculation were done using the same coverage inputs, without preventing garbage-collection
 * of those coverages.
 * <p>
 * Because a weak references created by this class may be shared by many, invoking
 * {@link Reference#clear} on them has no effect. Only the garbage-collector can
 * clear the references.
 *
 * {@note This class may be extended in a future version with coverage-specific enhancements.
 *        For example we could prevent the garbage-collection of a coverage as long as the JAI
 *        <code>TileCache</code> has not disposed the image tiles. This class is defined in this
 *        package instead than in the more generic <code>org.geotoolkit.util.collection</code>
 *        package for that reason.}

/**
 * Interface for {@link ImageReader} and {@link ImageWriter} implementations handling data
 * which can have more than two dimensions. The standard Java Image I/O API is designed for
 * two-dimensional data. The Geotk library can gives access to supplemental dimensions in
 * two different ways:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p>Using many {@link DimensionSlice} objects (one for each dimension) associated
 *       to a single {@link SpatialImageReadParam} object controlling the reading process.
 *       This approach is similar in spirit to the WCS 2.0 specification, but requires
 *       knowledge of Geotk API.</p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p>Using the standard Java Image I/O API for <cite>bands</cite> and <cite>image
 *       index</cite>. An advantage of this approach is to work with libraries having no
 *       knowledge of the Geotk-specific {@code DimensionSlice} class. This is the approach
 *       enabled by this {@code MultidimensionalImageStore} interface.</p></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * {@section Assigning a third dimension to bands}
 * Whatever a third dimension is assigned to bands or not is plugin-specific. Plugins that have
 * no concept of bands (like NetCDF which has the concept of <var>n</var>-dimensional data cube
 * instead) can do that. For example in a dataset having (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>z</var>,
 * <var>t</var>) dimensions, it may be useful to handle the <var>z</var> dimension as bands. After
 * the method calls below, users can select one or many elevation indices through the standard
 * {@link IIOParam#setSourceBands(int[])} API. Compared to the {@link DimensionSlice} API, it
 * allows loading more than one slice in a single read operation.
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     MultidimensionalImageStore reader = ...;
 *     DimensionIdentification bandsDimension = reader.getDimensionForAPI(DimensionSlice.API.BANDS);
 *     bandsDimension.addDimensionId(2); // 0-based index of the third dimension.
 * }
 *
 * When a dimension is assigned to bands as in the above example and if no
 * {@link IIOParam#sourceBands} array is specified, then all bands will be read.
 * This number of bands may be large, for example in NetCDF files. Users are advised
 * to always {@linkplain IIOParam#setSourceBands(int[]) set the source bands} when using
 * the band API for multi-dimensional data.
 * <p>
 * After the <var>z</var> dimension in the above example has been assigned to the bands API,
 * the bands can be used as below:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) plane at <var>z</var><sub>{@code sourceBands[0]}</sub> is stored in band 0.</li>
 *   <li>The (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) plane at <var>z</var><sub>{@code sourceBands[1]}</sub> is stored in band 1.</li>
 *   <li><i>etc.</i></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * {@section Note for implementors}
 * {@code ImageReader}Â and {@code ImageWriter} implementors can determine which (if any) dimension
 * index has been assigned to the bands API by using the code below:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     DimensionSet dimensionsForAPI = ...; // Typically an ImageReader/Writer field.
 *     DimensionIdentification bandsDimension = dimensionsForAPI.get(DimensionSlice.API.BANDS);
 *     if (bandsDimension != null) {
 *         Collection<?> propertiesOfAxes = ...; // This is plugin-specific.
 *         int index = bandsDimension.findDimensionIndex(propertiesOfAxes);
 *         if (index >= 0) {
 *             // We have found the dimension index of bands.
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * See also the {@link DimensionSet} javadoc for code snippet implementing the methods
 * declared in this interface.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Most implementations in this package are not public, because the API is very specific to the
    needs of the coverage catalog, may change in any future version, and could be considered as a
    duplicated (at least partially) of persistence frameworks like Hibernate. It was created before
    Hibernate became in wide use, and is still used because it provides us maximal control over the
    way we are querying the SQL database.</p>

    <p>This page gives an overview of the package design. We can not put this overview in the
    <code>package-info.java</code> class since it is not public API.</p>




    <hr><h1>Design overview</h1>
    <p>This package provides four kinds of objects, each with their own hierarchy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>Database</code> encapsulates a connection to a database. The connection is
          provided by a <code>javax.sql.DataSource</code>.</li>
      <li><code>Table</code> is the parent of every classes encapsulating a connection to a table
         in the database. Instances of <code>Table</code> are created by <code>Database</code>.</li>
      <li><code>Entry</code> is the parent of every classes encapsulating a record in a table.
         Instances of <code>Entry</code> are created by the corresponding <code>Table</code> only.</li>
      <li><code>Query</code> is the parent of every classes describing a query to be executed by
         a <code>Table</code>. A <code>Query</code> is made of <code>Column</code>s and
         <code>Parameter</code>s. Each <code>Column</code> instance can have an optional value
         used as a fallback if the column does not exist in the database, for compatibility with
         previous versions of the database schema. In addition, SQL <code>JOIN</code> clauses are
         built automatically by inspection of the <code>FOREIGNER KEY</code> declarations in the
         database, again for compatibility with older versions of this database schema.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Caching</h2>
    <p>This implementation may cache some database records. The mechanism works correctly when new
       entries are added in the database, but does not work if existing entries have been modified.
       In such case the caches need to be cleared. The easiest way to clean them is to dispose the
       old <code>Database</code> instance and create a new one using the copy constructor.</p>



    <hr><h1>Testing</h1>
    <p>In order to run the JUnit test suite provided in this module, the following file shall be provided:</p>
    <blockquote><pre>&lt;home directory&gt;/.geotoolkit.org/Tests/coverage-sql.properties</pre></blockquote>

    <p>The <code>.geotoolkit.org</code> directory may change depending on the platform. On MacOS, this is
       <code>Library/Geotoolkit.org</code>. This is the same directory than the one containing the EPSG
       database and the optional NADCON grid files.</p>

    <p>The <code>coverage-sql.properties</code> file shall have the content show below (replace the
       <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> blocks by the content appropriate for your environment).. The schema
       and user name can be changed if wanted - the values below are just proposals.</p>
<blockquote><pre># --------------------------------------------------------
# Connection to the PostgreSQL server for testing purpose.
# Do NOT commit this file, since it contains a password.
# --------------------------------------------------------
server   = &lt;put the name of your server here&gt;
database = &lt;put your database name here&gt;
schema   = coverages
user     = geoadmin
password = &lt;put your password here&gt;</pre></blockquote>

       large test files</a> page.</p>

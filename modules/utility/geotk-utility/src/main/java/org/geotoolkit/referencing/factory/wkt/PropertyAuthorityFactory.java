/**
 * A CRS Authority Factory that manages object creation using a set of static strings from a
 * {@linkplain java.util.Properties property file}. This gives some of the benefits of using
 * the {@linkplain org.geotoolkit.referencing.factory.epsg.DirectEpsgFactory EPSG database}
 * in a portable property file (which must be provided by the users), or add new authorities.
 * See {@link org.geotoolkit.referencing.factory.epsg.PropertyEpsgFactory} for a subclass
 * specialized for the EPSG authority.
 * <p>
 * This factory doesn't cache any result. Any call to a {@code createFoo} method
 * will trig a new WKT parsing. For adding caching service, this factory needs to
 * be wrapped in {@link org.geotoolkit.referencing.factory.CachingAuthorityFactory}.
 * The {@link AuthorityFactoryProvider#createFromProperties AuthorityFactoryProvider}
 * convenience class can be used for that purpose.

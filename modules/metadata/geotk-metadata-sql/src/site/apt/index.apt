Metadata on SQL

  Stores metadata in a SQL database. Each metadata class is mapped to a table,
  and each metadata attribute is mapped to a column in the appropriate table.
  Tables and columns are created only when first needed.

  See {{{../index.html}Overview of Metadata support in Geotoolkit.org}}.

# Test file for World File parsing.
#
# The values below do not provide an accurate localization of the matrix.txt file.
# Actually the geographic bounding box (ranging from 85째S to 85째N and from 87째W to
# 87째E) is quite wrong.  But we are interested only in testing the WorldFileReader
# capability to store those information in the image metadata.
#
# Note that the extension of this matrix.tfw file could have been 'ttw' according
# World File rules. The WorldFileReader should accept both.

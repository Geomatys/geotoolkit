/**
 *
 *  The AbstractStreetLocatorType is an abstract type  for describing the location on a street within an AddressType.
 *  We do this because the components of a location on a street vary greatly throughout the world.
 *  So that the schema can accommodate this variation we create derived types such as the
 *  BuildingLocatorType which has the components for an apartment or suite or floor within a building.
 *
 *
 * <p>Java class for AbstractStreetLocatorType complex type.

/**
 * Provides {@link org.geotoolkit.coverage.io.GridCoverageReader} implementations for creating
 * {@code GridCoverage2D} instances from a datasource. The main
 * implementation is {@link org.geotoolkit.coverage.io.ImageCoverageReader}, which read the
 * sample values using an {@link javax.imageio.ImageReader}Â from the standard Java library.
 * <p>
 * Many different data formats exist. However most of this variety is not handled by this package.
 * The various data formats are rather handled by different subclasses of {@code ImageReader},
 * for example
 * {@link org.geotoolkit.image.io.plugin.WorldFileImageReader}.
 * All those different {@code ImageReader} implementations can be wrapped by the
 * same {@link org.geotoolkit.coverage.io.ImageCoverageReader} implementation.

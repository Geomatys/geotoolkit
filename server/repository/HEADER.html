    <h1>Maven Repository: Geotoolkit, GeoAPI and dependencies</h1>

    <p align="justify">This is a repository contains Java Archive (JAR) files of
    <a href="http://www.geotoolkit.org/">Geotoolkit</a> modules and its dependencies including
    <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/">GeoAPI</a>. The repository follows the standard layout of
    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven&nbsp;2</a>, the project management tool used by
    Geotoolkit and other Java language projects. This repository adds to the
    a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">standard public Maven&nbsp;2 repository</a>. Users are
    welcome to rely on this repository for their own Maven&nbsp;2 builds.</p>

    <p align="justify">This repository contains modified <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">GeoTools</a>binaries
    in which some modules have been deleted and replaced by Maven dependencies to the Geotoolkit equivalent
    modules. They are provided as a convenience for those who want functionalities not yet ported to Geotoolkit,
    but without garanteed: some tests are known to fail. Those modified GeoTools modules and JAR file names are
    prefixed with "<code>gtm-</code>", to distinguish them from the official GeoTools distribution which prefix
    them with "<code>gt-</code>" and so should not conflict in any way.</p>

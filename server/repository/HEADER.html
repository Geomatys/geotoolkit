    <h1>Maven repository for Geotoolkit binaries and dependencies</h1>

    <p align="justify">This directory contains <a href="http://www.geotoolkit.org/">Geotoolkit</a> binaries and
    some dependencies not found in the <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/">standard public repository</a>.
    This is a complement (not a replacement) for the above repository. The directory layout is understood by
    <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a>, a project management tool used by the Geotoolkit project.
    Users are free to link their own project to this repository in order to get automatic downloads of
    Geotoolkit binaries.</p>

    <p align="justify">This repository contains also <a href="http://www.geotools.org/">GeoTools</a> binaries
    in which some modules have been deleted and replaced by Maven dependencies to the Geotoolkit equivalent
    modules. They are provided as a convenience for those who want functionalities not yet ported to Geotoolkit,
    but without garanteed: some tests are known to fail. Those modified GeoTools modules and JAR file names are
    prefixed with "<code>gtm-</code>", to distinguish them from the official GeoTools distribution which prefix
    them with "<code>gt-</code>".</p>

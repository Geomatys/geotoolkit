    <title>ServerStore</title>
    <para>
        There are a lot of different servers often with different functions (map displaying, processing or management for example). GeotoolKit regroup everything about distant inside <emphasis>Server</emphasis>.
It's not interesting to have only one server object about functionnality, because they offer too many different services. That's why an server instance implements generally an other interface more advanced and complete.
    </para>

    <para>
        For example, implementation :
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <emphasis>WebFeatureserver</emphasis> extends Server and DataStore because it's a remote service  which provide necessary to manipulate Features.
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <emphasis>WebMapServer</emphasis> and
                <emphasis>WebMapTileServer</emphasis> extend Server and CoverageStore because they provide pictures.
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>

            ServerFactory
        </title>
        <para>
	    The factory are using to make Servers. Each factory have its own name and the definition of its input paramaters that it need to create a new Server instance.
        </para>
        <para>
	    Factory implementations are registered in the Java Service Registry (META-INF/services). They enable automatic discovery of new implementations. The utility class  <emphasis>ServerFinder</emphasis> give us the possibity to get them quickly.
        </para>

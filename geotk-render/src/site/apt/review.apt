  - afabiani: apart usa.png the other test-data is safe. usa.png comes from GIDB client
              it shouldn't be reliable to be distributed under LGPL license.

* org.geotoolkit.renderer
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Contains a "unified" rendering interface for which several implementations have been
  made available.

  
* org.geotoolkit.renderer.lite
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Andrea's experimental simplified rendering pipeline, on the grounds that simple
  code can be debugged, and go fast.

    * ListenerList appears to hava JFace javadocs ... this needs to be fixed (or reimplemented)


* org.geotoolkit.renderer.lite.gridcoverage2d
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Think this was recently added from the coverage branch, (C) says 2002 ... going to guess 2005.


* org.geotoolkit.renderer.style
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Some code here dates back to 2003, appears to be some cross over with the geovista project (supporting
  dynamic style obejcts and the like).


* org.geotoolkit.renderer.[lite|style] (test)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Fun with JUnit.

    * some test case headers are cleary (C) 2002, so will need to use svn history 
      to sort this module out.

       A slew of files

       Taken from the user list, so ok.

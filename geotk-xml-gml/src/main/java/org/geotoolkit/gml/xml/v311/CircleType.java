/**
 * A Circle is an arc whose ends coincide to form a simple closed loop. The "start" and "end" bearing are equal and shall be the bearing for the first controlPoint listed. The three control points must be distinct non-co-linear points for the Circle to be unambiguously defined. The arc is simply extended past the third control point until the first control point is encountered.

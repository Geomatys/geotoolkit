/**
 * A Geodesic consists of two distinct
 *    positions joined by a geodesic curve. The control points of
 *    a Geodesic shall lie on the geodesic between its start
 *    point and end points. Between these two points, a geodesic
 *    curve defined from ellipsoid or geoid model used by the
 *    co-ordinate reference systems may be used to interpolate
 *    other positions. Any other point in the controlPoint array
 *    must fall on this geodesic.

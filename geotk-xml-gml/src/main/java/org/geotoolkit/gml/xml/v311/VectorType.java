/**
 * Vector instances hold the compoents for a (usually spatial) vector within some coordinate reference system (CRS).
 *          Since Vectors will often be included in larger objects that have references to CRS, the "srsName" attribute may be missing.
 *          In this case, the CRS is implicitly assumed to take on the value of the containing object's CRS.
 *
 *          Note that this content model is the same as DirectPositionType, but is defined separately to reflect the distinct semantics, and to avoid validation problems. SJDC 2004-12-02

       elements and types

	<!-- This schema uses the gml:MeasureType defined in basicTypes.xsd with the modified meaning:
			<documentation>Value of a quantity, with its units. This element uses the XML Schema primitive data type "double" because it supports both decimal and scientific notation, and thus offers flexibility and precision. However, there is no requirement to store values using any particular format, and applications receiving elements of this type may choose to coerce the data to any other type as convenient. The XML attribute uom references the units or scale by which the amount should be multiplied. For a reference within the same XML document, the abbreviated XPointer prefix "#" symbol should be used, followed by a text abbreviation of the unit name. However, the "#" symbol may be optional, and still may be interpreted as a reference. </documentation> -->

	<complexType name="GridLengthType">
		<annotation>
			<documentation>Value of a length (or distance) quantity in a grid, where the grid spacing does not have any associated physical units, or does not have a constant physical spacing. This grid length will often be used in a digital image grid, where the base units are likely to be pixel spacings. Uses the MeasureType with the restriction that the unit of measure referenced by uom must be suitable for length along the axes of a grid, such as pixel spacings or grid spacings.</documentation>

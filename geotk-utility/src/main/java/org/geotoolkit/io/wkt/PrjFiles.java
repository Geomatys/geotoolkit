/**
 * Parses and formats PRJ files. Those files usually have the {@code ".prj"} suffix and contain
 * the definition of exactly one <cite>Coordinate Reference System</cite> (CRS) in <cite>Well
 * Known Text</cite> (WKT) format. This class allows the definition to span many lines, but the
 * common practice is to provide the full WKT string on a single line.
 * <p>
 * If the definition is not a valid WKT string (during reads), or if a CRS can not be formatted as
 * a WKT (during writes), then the methods in this class throw a {@link ContentFormatException}.
 * This is a subclass of {@link IOException} and consequently does not require a <code>try &hellip;
 * catch</code> block different than the one for normal I/O operations.
 * <p>
 * Every files are expected to use the ISO-8859-1 (a.k.a. ISO-LATIN-1) encoding.

/**
 * Monitors the progress of some lengthly operation, and allows cancellation.
 * This abstract class makes no assumption about the output device. Additionally,
 * this class provides support for non-fatal warning and exception reports.
 * <p>
 * All implementations should be multi-thread safe, even the ones that provide
 * feedback to a user interface thread.
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     float scale = 100f / maximumCount;
 *     controller.started();
 *     for (int counter=0; counter<maximumCount; counter++) {
 *         if (controller.isCanceled()) {
 *             break;
 *         }
 *         controller.progress(scale * counter);
 *         try {
 *             // Do some work...
 *         } catch (NonFatalException e) {
 *             controller.exceptionOccurred(e);
 *         }
 *     }
 *     controller.complete();

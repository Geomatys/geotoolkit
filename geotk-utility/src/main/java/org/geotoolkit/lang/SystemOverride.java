/**
 * Marker interface for <cite>Service Providers</cite> that may override a JDK
 * service, or a service provided by a standard extension.
 * <p>
 * The default behavior (to override the standard provider or not) is provider-dependent.
 * However the actual behavior can be forced explicitly. For example Geotk can be prevented
 * from overriding any standard JDK or extension services in the two ways show below.
 * <p>
 * From the command line:
 *
 * {@preformat shell
 *     java -Dgeotk.system.override=false mypackage.MyMainClass
 * }
 *
 * or programmatically:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     package mypackage;
 *
 *     public class MyMainClass {
 *         public static void main(String[] args) {
 *             System.setProperty(SystemOverride.KEY_ALLOW_OVERRIDE, "false");
 *             // Launch the application now.
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * For a complete list of Geotk services that can override standard services, see the
 * "<cite>All Known Implementing Classes</cite>" section above.

/**
 * A tree node with a name which may be different than the {@linkplain #userObject user object}.
 * Because the {@link javax.swing.JTree} component invokes the {@link #toString()} method for
 * populating the tree widget, this class is useful when the label to display is different than
 * the value of {@code userObject.toString()}.
 *
 * {@section Localization}
 * Every constructors in this class expect a name of type {@link CharSequence}. The names are
 * typically instances of {@link String}, but instances of {@link InternationalString} are
 * also accepted. In the later case, the {@link #toString()} method may return a localized
 * string depending on the return value of the {@link #getLocale() getLocale()} method. By
 * default, the later is the locale of the {@linkplain #getParent() parent} node.

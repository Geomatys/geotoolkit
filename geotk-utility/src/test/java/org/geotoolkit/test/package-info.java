/**
 * Tools for Geotk test suites. This package defines a base class, {@link org.geotoolkit.test.TestBase}, which
 * is extended by many Geotk test suite. This package defines also an {@link org.geotoolkit.test.Assert} class
 * which extends {@link org.junit.Assert} with the addition of assertion methods commonly used in Geotk test
 * suite.
 * <p>
 * By default, successful tests do not produce any output. However it is possible to ask for verbose
 * output, which is sometime useful for debugging purpose. The following properties can be set to
 * {@code true}Â for that purpose:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@value org.geotoolkit.test.TestBase#VERBOSE_KEY} for more console output</li>
 *   <li>{@value org.geotoolkit.test.gui.SwingTestBase#SHOW_PROPERTY_KEY} for showing images or widgets</li>
 * </ul>

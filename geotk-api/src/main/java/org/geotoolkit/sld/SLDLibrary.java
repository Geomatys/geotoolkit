 * The UseSLDLibrary element provides the ability of handling external SLD documents
 * to be used in library-mode even when using XML-encoded POST requests with a WMS.
 * (The library mode can be accessed with the HTTP-GET method by supplying an SLD
 * CGI parameter in addition to LAYERS and STYLES CGI parameters.) This addition
 * merely exercises pre-existing functionality in WMS, but it does add the wrinkle of
 * making SLD-library references iterative and (syntactically) recursive. Successive
 * definitions are applied “on top of” previous ones to determine the scoping of overlapping
 * style definitions.

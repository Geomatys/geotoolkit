/**
 * The header information of an object is designed to encompass all of the
 * information about an object, except for the data itself. This information
 * includes the dataspace, the datatype, information about how the data is
 * stored on disk (in external files, compressed, broken up in blocks, and so
 * on), as well as other information used by the library to speed up access to
 * the data objects or maintain a file’s integrity. Information stored by user
 * applications as attributes is also stored in the object’s header. The header
 * of each object is not necessarily located immediately prior to the object’s
 * data in the file and in fact may be located in any position in the file. The
 * order of the messages in an object header is not significant.
 *
 * Object headers are composed of a prefix and a set of messages. The prefix
 * contains the information needed to interpret the messages and a small amount
 * of metadata about the object, and the messages contain the majority of the
 * metadata about the object.

/**
 * Data object header messages are small pieces of metadata that are stored in
 * the data object header for each object in an HDF5 file. Data object header
 * messages provide the metadata required to describe an object and its contents,
 * as well as optional pieces of metadata that annotate the meaning or purpose
 * of the object.
 *
 * Data object header messages are either stored directly in the data object header
 * for the object or are shared between multiple objects in the file. When a
 * message is shared, a flag in the Message Flags indicates that the actual
 * Message Data portion of that message is stored in another location (such as
 * another data object header, or a heap in the file) and the Message Data field
 * contains the information needed to locate the actual information for the message.
